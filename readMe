Validations are working, but the form itself isn't submitting, I need to go back and look at where to submit in the text so I can remember how to do it in a JS file and not in HTML file. 

myFetch function is not returning anything, perhaps the return needs to be moved up a bit?

planets in scriptHelper.js is undefined.

Validations are working.  Form will submit when everthing is correct with the myFetch function.

myfetch is still not working properly. response is undefined is the thing that seems to be throwing it off.  

At the moment there are no errors with the pickPlanet function, but that could change depending on how the myFetch works out.
